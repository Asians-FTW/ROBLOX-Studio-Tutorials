# ROBLOX-Studio-Tutorials
This contains the source code for every script from my ROBLOX Studio Tutorial Series in addition to a tutorial setup model that can be imported into ROBLOX Studio.

If it's difficult to find what you need here, you can go to **[this page](https://asians-ftw.github.io/ROBLOX-Studio-Tutorials/)** for a cleaner experience.


This repository will be updated periodically (upon the release of each tutorial), once a handful of my existing tutorials have been remade.
